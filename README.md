# Functions
- Supports 8 different MIDI sounds, enabling the triggering of diverse drums or samples loaded into a drum rack.
- Allows effortless creation and switching between 3 distinct patterns.
- Each pattern consists of 16 steps, with the option to link two patterns for a 32-step sequencer.
- Adjustable tempo, capable of halving the speed, ideal for handling longer samples.
- Visual feedback through RGB (ws2812b) LEDs, indicating MIDI sound and step positions.
- Dedicated buttons for placing individual sounds or samples on each step.
- Compact design, measuring under 0.5cm tall, 12.8cm long, and 8cm wide.

# How it works
The beatrmatrix device is simply a controller for the Max patcher. All the "magic" happens within the patcher.
